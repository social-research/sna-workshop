# Introduction to Social Network Analysis

**MY560 Workshop in Advanced Quantitative Analysis**

London School of Economics and Political Science

## Description

The workshop introduces basic concepts, measures, and methods used in network analysis, with examples from across the social sciences. In the morning, we will overview topics such as node centrality, network clustering, assortativity, communities, and contagion processes on networks. In the afternoon, we will follow a hands-on tutorial and conduct two types of analysis with real data: 

1. Ego-network analysis of survey data with name generators
2. Visualization and descriptive analysis of a whole network. 

The workshop is suitable to both quantitative and qualitative researchers. No programming background or knowledge is required. 

## Software

We will use **R** to write and run code. If you already have **R and RStudio** installed on your machine:

1. Clone/download this repository on your computer by clicking on the green `Code` button above.
2. Open the `.Rmd` file from the cloned repository in RStudio.

If you do not have access to or any experience with RStudio, still download the files, then simply open the .html file in your browser and follow along.

## Further SNA Resources

The session presents an extremely cursive overview of a large interdisciplinary field of study. There are numerous books, courses, conferences, academic degree programs, and other resources for those who would like to pursue network analysis at a deeper level. Below I list three wonderful and freely available resources that I can recommend:

* Graduate course MY461 Social Network Analysis at LSE, taught by Eleanor Power and myself
* Collection of literature, datasets, courses, and many other resources related to network analysis by François Briatte: [https://github.com/briatte/awesome-network-analysis](https://github.com/briatte/awesome-network-analysis)
* Textbook on egocentric network analysis in R by Raffaele Vacca: [https://raffaelevacca.github.io/egocentric-r-book/](https://raffaelevacca.github.io/egocentric-r-book/)
* Tutorials on network analysis and visualization by Katya Ognyanova: [https://kateto.net/tutorials/](https://kateto.net/tutorials/)
